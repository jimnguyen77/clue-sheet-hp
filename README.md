# Clue Board Game Sheet

This Clue Board Game sheet is the digital version (written in React + TypeScript + Vite + MUI) of the paper sheets that come with the board game.  It's also possible to print the sheet directly from the rendered page.

This is the "Harry Potter" variant.  The original can be found here: https://github.com/jimnguyen77/clue-sheet
